Contour may require some additional setup:

  1. Add the following line to your application_controller.rb
  
       layout "contour/layouts/application"
  
  2. Edit your application.js manifest to use Contour JavaScript
  
       //= require contour
  
  3. Edit your application.css manifest to use Contour CSS
       
       *= require contour
  
  4. Make sure to remove any scaffold.css files that exist in your application
  
  5. Make sure your user model has first_name and last_name
